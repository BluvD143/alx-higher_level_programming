# PYTHON - INHERITANCE

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.

It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

- Use `isinstance()` to check an instanceâ€™s type: `isinstance(obj, int)` will be `True` only if `obj.__class__` is `int` or some class derived from `int`.

- Use  `issubclass()` to check class inheritance: `issubclass(bool, int)` is `True` since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is `False` since `float` is not a subclass of `int`.
