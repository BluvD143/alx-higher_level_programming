# Python - Classes and Objects

## Classes
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

## Some points on Python class:  

* * Classes are created by keyword class.
* * Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
* * Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

## Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.
An object consists of : 

* * State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
* * Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
* * Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

## Tasks
This project contains *10 Tasks* in all
- 6 mandatory
- 4 advanced
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
